# Overview

## What is this project?

The goal of this project is to collaborate with your Collab Lab team to create a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù shopping list app that learns your buying habits and helps you remember what you‚Äôre likely to need to buy on your next trip to the store.

## How does it work?

As a user, you will enter items (e.g., ‚ÄúGreek yogurt‚Äù or ‚ÄúPaper towels‚Äù) into your list. Each time you buy the item, you mark it as purchased in the list. Over time, the app comes to understand the intervals at which you buy different items. If an item is likely to be due to be bought soon, it rises to the top of the shopping list.

## Check out an example

The app will work in many of the same ways as [iNeedToBuy.xyz](https://app.ineedtobuy.xyz/) (on which our project is based) with the exception that we will not be implementing barcode scanning (that feature would add a lot of scope to the project and wasn‚Äôt all that useful).

## More details for contributors

üéâ  &nbsp; If you‚Äôre a Collab Lab participant, first of all: WELCOME! We‚Äôre so excited to work with you and collaborate on something amazing.

### Make your first contribution!

The first thing you will want to do before your kick-off call is make your first contribution to this repo. This will help make sure you‚Äôre ready to go on day one.

- Get this project set up locally by following the instructions [below in this README](#project-setup).
- Add your name to the [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) file
  - Be sure to do this from your local environment and not from GitHub in your browser. The purpose (aside from highlighting our amazing team) is to make sure your local environment is all set up and ready to go come day 1!
  - Commit to the `main` branch and push it up to the remote repo. (Over the next 8 weeks, we will rely on feature branches as we collaborate on the project, but for this task committing to main will do just fine.)

### What else should contributors know?
For additional details on how your cohort will operate, please check out the [project brief](PROJECT-BRIEF.md).

# Project setup

## Download Node and NPM

* `npm` is distributed with Node.js which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get `npm` installed on your computer.
* Follow the [instructions here to install Node.js and `npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## Clone project locally

* On GitHub, navigate to the repo for your cohort‚Äôs project (you‚Äôre probably there right now, click the "Code" tab at the top).
![screenshot of "Code" tab on GitHub](https://cdn.zappy.app/7751e7784910a8c64b47106e24fd3dd1.png)
* Click the green "Clone or download" button and copy the web URL.
![screenshot of how to copy the web URL for a GitHub repo](https://cdn.zappy.app/c5fa2c9e72f6cfbd15fb27f4ed2dc898.png)
* From your terminal, `cd` into the directory where you want this project to live.
![screenshot of how to navigate folders in terminal](https://cdn.zappy.app/8a4302d1262bc08fa61e8cd2f3b7c3b8.png)
* Once you‚Äôre in the directory, type `git clone` followed by the web URL you just copied to your clipboard from GitHub.
![screenshot of how to git clone](https://cdn.zappy.app/7a9553b7cc4949beecd8db6f32e631a4.png)
* Then navigate into the project by typing `cd` followed by the project directory‚Äôs name.

## Update dependencies

* Once you have the project locally and you are in the project directory, you‚Äôll want to update all the project‚Äôs dependencies. To do so, type the following into your terminal: `npm update`
![screenshot of npm update in the terminal](https://cdn.zappy.app/b7619c19e38166329334430335746d3b.png)
* Maybe take a sip of coffee or check in on Twitter, this could take a minute -- don‚Äôt worry.

## Access the project in your browser

* After you‚Äôve cloned the project locally and updated the dependencies, you should be able to see the project at `localhost:3000`.

üéâ You did it! You‚Äôre ready to start contributing. Don‚Äôt forget to complete the first task by adding your name to [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) from your local enviroment, committing those changes, and creating a pull request.

# Boilerplate information

Everything in this section is automatically generated when you create a new app using `create-react-app`. These details can be really helpful in learning how to launch and manage your React app with `npm`.

## ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì create-react-app boilerplate ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
